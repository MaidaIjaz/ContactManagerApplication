# Client Contacts Manager Application

The idea behind this application is to have a system that allows a sales team to manage and access the contact details of their clients and the companies they work with.

## Contacts section

The main features of this application are as follows:

* View a list of contacts
* Search through the available contacts
* View the details of a selected contact
* Edit the details of a contact
* Add a new contact to the system
* Remove a contact from the system

## Companies section 

Thereâ€™s also going to be a Company section because each contact must belong to a company, as our salesperson needs to be able to find the contacts for a particular company. So, in the Company section, the salesperson will be able to do the following:

* View all the companies
* Search for a company by the name
* View the details of a selected company
* Edit the details of a selected company
* Add a new company to the system
* Remove a company from the system

## Development server

Run `npm install` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
